That\\'s politics though, I know that much.I think Harris is a great person, and a good candidate. I also think some of the awful things people have been saying about her these past few days are just way out of line. That being said, her approach during that portion of the debate was less than what I wanted from her. Even more than that, her campaign\\'s actions after the debate have really made me think less of her as a candidate. Immediately selling shirts with that image, which was clearly planned in advance of the debate, is too much. Don\\'t misconstrue any of this as me not liking Harris, I\\'d still take her any day against what we currently have in the oval office. She just isn\\'t my #1 choice.Every poll says something different. Some say he’s down, others say up. A lot are saying he’s going up with black voters even more.Uhh, he is the frontrunner.I was surprised that didn\\'t come up tonight! That\\'s one of my BIGGEST issues with her, and they brought it up for a candidate last night.I like Booker a lot, and think he\\'s really going to go places (he\\'s already gone to some great places though). I think he also did a great job last night. I would suggest putting him in Sanders place, but I know that goes against the polls completely. Maybe he\\'ll have a better shot a few years down the line.Whenever I\\'ve been in Biden\\'s presence I\\'ve always felt that his heart is in everything he does, and that is true now more than ever. He cares deeply about America, and the American people, and will do everything in his power to take down Trump and restore our status of respect worldwide.Thanks for the positivity! I definitely won\\'t forget tonight, that\\'s for sure.When Lester Holt was in the audience speaking? Yes, I did! I was wearing a blue button up if that helps. Maybe you can get a picture and we’ll see if it was me? That also sounds like a lot of effort for no reward, so you do you haha.Is it sad that I knew it wasn\\'t me in the first half of the sentence? No, I was not in the front row! I was in the orchestra though, and I was in a few shots with some of the candidates as they were talking with people after the debate. It was amazing to be there.I\\'m a big Biden supporter, and I\\'m definitely going to be voting for him, but after being a proud Biden Supporter I\\'m also a proud member of the Democratic Party. I\\'m really happy to see the majority of people here have signed on to the \"Vote Blue No Matter Who\" way of thinking, which is exactly what we need to beat Donald Trump.Hahah, I think I had more screen time than Inslee did!But what would you say to plans that give healthcare to all without abolishing systems we have in place? That\\'s my biggest issue with the plans put forward.I made it on camera a few times tonight!'"
