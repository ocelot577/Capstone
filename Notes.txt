Notes

probably don't want to use sentiment to characterize users
- example of misclassifications
-- "Hell ya. This sign of yeetism just made me donate $10. You dropping two Yang's caused an AoE burst of mini donations."
--- score:  -0.68080

ideas to create my target column
- 5+ posts in specific sub, no posts in other subs
- how about a weighted analysis
-- 90% of canidate posts on a specific subreddit
